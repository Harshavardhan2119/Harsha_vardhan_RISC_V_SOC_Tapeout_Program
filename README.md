## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** by **VSD (VLSI System Design)** — an initiative that enables participants to take a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from **RTL to GDSII** using only **open-source tools**.

Over 3500+ engineers across India are part of this collaborative program to build real silicon using the **Sky130 process node** and the **RISC-V ISA**.

## 🧰 Week 0 – Environment Setup & Tool Installation

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Task 0](Week0/Task0/README.md) | 🛠️ Installed `Icarus Verilog`, `Yosys`, and `GTKWave` | ✅ Completed |

### 🔍 Key Learnings

- Installed and configured key open-source EDA tools:
  - **Icarus Verilog** – for simulation
  - **Yosys** – for RTL synthesis
  - **GTKWave** – for waveform viewing
- Verified installations with test cases.
- Prepared the environment for the complete SoC design flow.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

In the following stages, I’ll be working on:

- RTL design in Verilog  
- Simulation and debugging  
- Logic synthesis and formal verification  
- Floorplanning, placement, and routing  
- GDSII generation for physical tapeout

Each step will be documented in its respective folder.
