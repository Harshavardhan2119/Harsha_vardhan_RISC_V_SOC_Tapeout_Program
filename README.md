## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey as part of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by VSD** — one of India’s largest open-source silicon initiatives.  
The goal: to build a **complete System-on-Chip (SoC)** using only **free and open-source tools**, progressing from **RTL design to GDSII generation**.

Over 3500+ participants across India are part of this collaborative effort to **design, simulate, synthesize, and physically implement silicon chips** using RISC-V architecture and Sky130 process.
